# snort Cookbook

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/sous-chefs/snort.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/sous-chefs/snort) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/snort.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/snort)

Installs the SNORT IDS daemon.

## Requirements

### Platforms

- RHEL/CentOS, 7.0 and higher only.
- Fedora
- Debian 8+
- Amazon Linux 2

### Chef

- Chef 12.7+

## Resources

### Install

- On Ubuntu systems, the packages from apt are used.
- On RHEL and Fedora systems, the packages are retrieved directly from the SNORT project site.
- On Debian the test recipe forces a compiled install.

### Config

Configures `/etc/snort/snort.conf`. We recommend you put your own config in disk using the file resource.

### Rules

Downloads rules for snort.

### Service

Used to setup the `snort_service` for use in other resources.

## Usage

An example usage pattern can be found in the test cookbook.

- Use the `snort_install` to install the package. This also creates the `snort_service` resource which you can use to stop, start & enable the snort service correctly.

RHEL based systems you _must_ use the following resources (optional on Debian based systems).

- Use `snort_config` to configure the system.
- Use `snort_rules` to install rules. You will need a licence for this.

Example configs can be found in `test/fixtures/cookbooks/test/`
